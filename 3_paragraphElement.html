            A static website is delivered to a user exactly the way it's stored. That means that nothing on the page will change by the user or even the site administrator unless there's a redesign of the site, or the site administrator goes directly into the code to change it.

            A static web page is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored, in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.
